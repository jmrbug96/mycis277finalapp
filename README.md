# mycis277finalapp
Due to the complications I experienced with files in repl.it, I had to create most of my final app in Code::Blocks on my Raspberry Pi.
Key features in the app, such as the ANSI codes for changing the foreground colors and clearing the console via 'system("clear")',
only work in Linux environments.
