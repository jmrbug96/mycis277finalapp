## Book Recommender

This app lists many books that I personally recommend. The user can select a book in the list and a brief description will be displayed along with a link to where the book can be purchased. It will also say whether or not the book is public domain. If it is, a link will also be displayed to read the book legally online for free.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jmrbug96/mycis277finalapp/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
